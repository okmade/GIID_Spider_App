This App started as a personal project, to show my students features they can reach with different skill about Robotics.

This App works with SpiderBot GIID which use this features:

* Hardware:

** Raspberry Pi  3 A+
** Camera v2.1 for Raspberry Pi
** PCA 9685 (Servo Controller)
** UBEC 5v/20A (Servo Power)
** UBEC 5v/3A (Raspberry Pi Power)
** Battery 7.4v/5000mA

* Software:
** Rasbian OS
** Python 3
** Flask library (Main Web Server)
** mjpg-streamer (Camera Web Server)
** Adafruit libraries (Control GPIO, PCA9685)

Versions:
* v0.1: First Body with Servos TowerPro SG90.
* v0.2: Development of Servos Controller (Python)
* v0.3: Leg's controller development
* v0.4: Body's controller developmnet
* v0.5: Second Body with Servos TowerPro MG90

Issues: I try to fix as many I can find, software has been changed a lot with time, because I always find a better way to develop different parts of the SpiderBot.
